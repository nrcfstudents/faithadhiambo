                <h3>student indexing.</h3>
               <p>The Council through its Indexing Section verifies submissions to ensure that students admitted to training schools meet the minimum admission criteria for their programme of choice. Once verification is completed, you will be assigned an ‘Index Number’ which is a unique reference that will remain your identification throughout training and practice. The outcome of the indexing process will be communicated to you through your training institution, SMS and email notifications.</p>
