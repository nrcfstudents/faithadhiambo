            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>We are advocates for people by promoting the delivery of the right care at the right time. We practice human caring. We listen to our patients and their loved ones, and we place them at the center of all planning and decision-making. We meet each person where they are in the moment. </p>
            <p>My mission and vision for myself as a professional nurse is to provide patient-focused care for the whole person, considering their physical, mental, and emotional health. I vow to be a lifelong learner, an advocate for my patients, and a nurse who inspires hope in those that I am caring for 2030 </p>
